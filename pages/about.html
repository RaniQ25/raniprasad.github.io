  <h1>Some Context</h1>

  <p>
    I am a PhD research scholar in Science Education at the
    <strong>Homi Bhabha Centre for Science Education (HBCSE), Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR), Mumbai</strong>,
    where my work focuses on children’s learning of science, particularly at the elementary level.
    My academic interests lie in understanding how students engage with ideas related to the environment,
    and how curriculum, pedagogy, and educational resources shape these learning experiences.
  </p>

  <p>
    Alongside my doctoral research, I have worked as an education researcher at the
    <strong>Centre of Excellence in Teacher Education (CETE), Tata Institute of Social Sciences (TISS), Mumbai</strong>.
    In this role, I was involved in organizing and coordinating educational leadership and management programmes
    in collaboration with the <strong>Royal Government of Bhutan</strong>, as well as the governments of
    <strong>Madhya Pradesh</strong> and <strong>Odisha</strong>.
    I was also part of the <strong>Interactive Flat Panel (IFP) Project</strong> with SCERT, Telangana,
    where my work centred on the curation, adaptation, and design of
    <strong>Open Educational Resources (OERs)</strong> aligned with school curricula.
  </p>

  <p>
    In addition to my research experience, I have taught <strong>Biology to Grades 11 and 12</strong> in Mumbai, India.
    As an educator, I am committed to fostering a <strong>practical, child-centred approach</strong> to teaching and learning,
    and I value pedagogical practices that emphasise conceptual understanding, inquiry,
    and student participation.
    My teaching and research experiences continually inform one another,
    shaping how I think about classrooms, curriculum design, and educational equity.
  </p>

  <p>
    My broader academic work engages with <strong>science education research, elementary education,
    environmental education, curriculum studies, and OERs</strong>,
    with an interest in how learning is experienced and supported within various educational settings.
    Through research, teaching, and collaborative work, I aim to contribute to
    <strong>critical, meaningful, and contextually grounded approaches to education</strong>.
  </p>
